Your prompts and data will be sent to the provider’s servers (e.g., Google’s servers for Gemini). These providers may use your data according to their own privacy policies. The additional risk with public LLMs is the much wider dataset they use for training. Your input data could potentially be incorporated into that dataset, making it accessible to other users or used for future model training.<br><br>For highly sensitive or confidential information, we strongly recommend using a local provider instead.'
